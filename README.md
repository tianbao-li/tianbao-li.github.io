This homepage is largely based on the open-source work of [yaoyao-liu/homepage](https://github.com/yaoyao-liu/homepage). We sincerely appreciate their contributions.

### Using Locally with Jekyll

You need to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) first.

Install and run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll server
```
View the live page using `localhost`:
<http://localhost:4000>. You can get the html files in the `_site` folder.
